# OI Preparations
over 200 tasks (undocumented ofc) that nobody waited for.
This is huge win for me that I've been able to succed in Olimpic in Informatics this year (2023-2024).
These tasks are not well written i had no time to do so. I just want to leave it here public as a trophy of what i have achieved this year.

tasks are in 3 folders: 
- archive1-11.11.2k23
- archive2-17.02.2k24
- tasks
These are not all tasks i've been doing. I would say its 2/3 of all.
They are usually named <code_of_task>_<shortcut> and they are in 70% from szkopul.

## For posterity
If you are looking for help in preparation you can reach me out i can try to help you out :)
I will also put somwhere here my olimpic template for testing with bash scripts ideal for finals;

## How to use small template

To add task use `add` command
```cmd
make add TASK=<task_name>
```

To run task use default `all` command
```cmd
make TASK=<task_name>
```

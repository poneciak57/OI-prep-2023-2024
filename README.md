# Tribute of my long journey
I started my preparation to Polish Olimpiad in Informatics in September 2023.
After final third round in Warsaw 12 April 2024 i achived laureate title and won a bronze medal.
This was a huge win for me because in over half a year i learn about algorithms, data structures, graphs and much more at the advanced level. And i have been able to compete with best of the bests.

Here are over 200 tasks (undocumented ofc) that nobody waited for.
These tasks are not well written i had no time to do so. 
I just want to leave it here public as a trophy.

tasks are in 3 folders: 
- archive1-11.11.2k23
- archive2-17.02.2k24
- tasks
These are not all tasks i've been doing. I would say its 2/3 of all.
They are usually named <code_of_task>_<shortcut> and they are in 70% from szkopul.

## For posterity
If you are looking for help in preparation you can reach me out i can try to help you out :)
I will also put somwhere here my olimpic template for testing with bash scripts ideal for stationary rounds;

## How to use my windows template
This template uses windows make to easily run and add new tasks.
In task template u have `main.cpp` for code, `input.txt` for input data and `output.txt` for output.

To add task use `add` command
```cmd
make add TASK=<task_name>
```

To run task use default `all` command
```cmd
make TASK=<task_name>
```
